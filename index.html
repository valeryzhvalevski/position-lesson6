            <h1>Some text about</h1>
            <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves /ˈeɪviːz/, characterised by
                feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a
                four-chambered
                heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm
                (2.2
                in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more
                than
                half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to
                species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which
                evolved
                from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight
                in
                some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and
                respiratory
                systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments,
                particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.</p>
            <p>Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds
                are
                considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are
                the
                crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx)
                which
                first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds
                (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of
                the
                Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian
                dinosaurs.
            </p>
            <p>Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds
                are
                social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as
                cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species
                are
                socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes
                for
                years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many
                females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs
                which
                are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the
                parents.
                Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.</p>
